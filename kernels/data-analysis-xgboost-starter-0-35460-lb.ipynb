    "# Identifying Duplicate Questions\n\nWelcome to the Quora Question Pairs competition! Here, our goal is to identify which questions asked on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), a quasi-forum website with over 100 million visitors a month, are duplicates of questions that have already been asked. This could be useful, for example, to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered. We are tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not, and submitting a binary prediction against the logloss metric.\n\nIf you have any questions or want to discuss competitions/hardware/games/anything with other Kagglers, then join the KaggleNoobs Slack channel [here](https://goo.gl/gGWFXe). We also have regular AMAs with top Kagglers there.\n\n**And as always, if this helped you, some upvotes would be very much appreciated - that's where I get my motivation! :D**\n\nLet's dive right into the data!"

According to the [data page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/data), most of the rows in the test set are using auto-generated questions to pad out the dataset, and deter any hand-labelling. This means that the true number of rows that are scored could be very low.\n\nWe can actually see in the head of the test data that some of the questions are obviously auto-generated, as we get delights such as \"How their can I start reading?\" and \"What foods fibre?\". Truly insightful questions.\n\nNow onto the good stuff - the text data!\n## Text analysis\n\nFirst off, some quick histograms to understand what we're looking at. **Most analysis here will be only on the training set, to avoid the auto-generated questions**"

Could this be some sort of Quora question size limit?\n\nIt's also worth noting that I've truncated this histogram at 200 characters, and that the max of the distribution is at just under 1200 characters for both sets - although samples with over 200 characters are very rare.\n\nLet's do the same for word count.

Interestingly, it seems very good at identifying questions which are definitely different, but is not so great at finding questions which are definitely duplicates.\n\n## TF-IDF\n\nI'm now going to try to improve this feature, by using something called TF-IDF (term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency). This means that we weigh the terms by how **uncommon** they are, meaning that we care more about rare words existing in both questions than common one. This makes sense, as for example we care more about whether the word \"exercise\" appears in both than the word \"and\" - as uncommon words will be more indicative of the content.\n\nYou may want to look into using sklearn's [TfidfVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) to compute weights if you are implementing this yourself, but as I am too lazy to read the documentation I will write a version in pure python with a few changes which I believe should help the score."

    "So it looks like our TF-IDF actually got _worse_ in terms of overall AUC, which is a bit disappointing. (I am using the AUC metric since it is unaffected by scaling and similar, so it is a good metric for testing the predictive power of individual features.\n\nHowever, I still think that this feature should provide some extra information which is not provided by the original feature. Our next job is to combine these features and use it to make a prediction. For this, I will use our old friend XGBoost to make a classification model.\n\n## Rebalancing the Data\nHowever, before I do this, I would like to rebalance the data that XGBoost receives, since we have 37% positive class in our training data, and only 17% in the test data. By re-balancing the data so our training set has 17% positives, we can ensure that XGBoost outputs probabilities that will better match the data on the leaderboard, and should get a better score (since LogLoss looks at the probabilities themselves and not just the order of the predictions like AUC)"
